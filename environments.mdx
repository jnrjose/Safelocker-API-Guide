The Safe Locker API provides two environments: **Test** and **Live**. These environments allow you to safely develop and test your integration before deploying to production.

---

## Overview of Environments

- **Test Environment**: Used for simulating API interactions without affecting real data. Ideal for development, debugging, and testing.
  
- **Live Environment**: For production use. All actions in this environment affect real data, so only authorized production API keys should be used here.

<Callout title="Important" type="warning">
Ensure you are using the correct environment before making requests, as actions in the Live environment are irreversible.
</Callout>

## How to Switch Environments

### 1. Base URLs for Environments

To switch between environments, update the **base URL** in your API requests.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Test Environment">
**Base URL**: `https://api.test.fezdelivery.co`
</Tab>

<Tab title="Live Environment">
**Base URL**: `https://api.fezdelivery.co`
</Tab>
</Tabs>

**Example**:

<CodeBlock title="API Request Example" language="http">
```http
# Test Environment
GET https://api.test.fezdelivery.co/lockers/status
Authorization: Bearer your-test-access-token

# Live Environment
GET https://api.fezdelivery.co/lockers/status
Authorization: Bearer your-live-access-token
```
</CodeBlock>

### 2. Using Environment-Specific API Keys

Each environment requires its own API key.

- **Test API Key**: Use only in the Test environment (`https://api.test.fezdelivery.co`).
- **Live API Key**: Use only in the Live environment (`https://api.fezdelivery.co`).

> **Tip**: Label your API keys in the dashboard to avoid confusion between test and live keys.

### 3. Switching Environments in Code

Use environment variables to manage your base URL and API keys dynamically.

<CodeBlock title="Example Environment Variables in JavaScript (Node.js)" language="javascript">
```javascript
const BASE_URL = process.env.API_BASE_URL;
const API_KEY = process.env.API_KEY;

async function getLockerStatus() {
  const response = await fetch(`${BASE_URL}/lockers/status`, {
    method: 'GET',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${API_KEY}`
    }
  });
  const data = await response.json();
  console.log(data);
}
```
</CodeBlock>

## Differences Between Test and Live Environments

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="1. Data Persistence">
- **Test Environment**: Data created here is temporary and may be reset periodically.
- **Live Environment**: Data is permanent and affects real records. Only use this environment for production data.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="2. Notifications and Alerts">
- **Test Environment**: Notifications are simulated and may not reach real recipients.
- **Live Environment**: All notifications are fully functional. Verify settings to avoid unintended alerts.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="3. Rate Limits and Quotas">
- **Test Environment**: Rate limits are typically more lenient, but excessive calls may still be limited.
- **Live Environment**: Production-level rate limits apply, and exceeding limits may result in restrictions.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="4. Security and Access Control">
- **Test Environment**: Security measures may be relaxed for testing, but follow best practices for data security.
- **Live Environment**: Full security measures apply, including IP whitelisting and restricted permissions.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="5. Billing and Usage Tracking">
- **Test Environment**: No charges are incurred for requests in the Test environment.
- **Live Environment**: API calls are billed according to your usage plan. Monitor costs, especially for high-frequency requests.
</Accordion>

## Best Practices for Managing Environments

<Callout title="Best Practices" type="tip">
1. **Use Separate API Keys**: Always use separate keys for test and live environments.
2. **Set Up Environment Variables**: Use environment variables for base URLs and API keys for easy switching.
3. **Restrict Live Access**: Limit access to the Live environment to authorized personnel only.
4. **Test Thoroughly**: Use the Test environment to validate all functionality before deploying to production.
5. **Monitor Usage**: Keep an eye on rate limits and billing in the Live environment.
</Callout>

## Example Environment Setup in `.env` Files

Set up `.env` files for each environment to store API keys and base URLs securely.

<CodeGroup>
<CodeBlock title=".env.test">
```plaintext
API_BASE_URL=https://api.test.fezdelivery.co
API_KEY=your-test-api-key
```
</CodeBlock>

<CodeBlock title=".env.live">
```plaintext
API_BASE_URL=https://api.fezdelivery.co
API_KEY=your-live-api-key
```
</CodeBlock>
</CodeGroup>

> **Pro Tip**: Use libraries like `dotenv` in Node.js to load these environment variables based on the environment.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="How do I know which environment I'm using?">
Check the base URL in your API requests. `https://api.test.fezdelivery.co` indicates the Test environment, while `https://api.fezdelivery.co` indicates the Live environment.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I test all features in the Test environment?">
Yes, the Test environment supports all API functionalities, allowing you to simulate requests and verify responses. However, notifications and alerts may be simulated and not reach real recipients.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What happens to data in the Test environment?">
Data in the Test environment is temporary and may be reset periodically. Use this environment for testing only, as data will not be retained long-term.
</Accordion>
