title: "Rate Limiting"
description: The Safe Locker API enforces rate limits to ensure fair usage and maintain performance. Exceeding these limits will result in a `429 Too Many Requests` error, indicating that your application has reached the maximum allowed requests within a specific time period.
---

## What is Rate Limiting?

Rate limiting restricts the number of API requests that a client can make within a given time frame. This prevents overuse of resources and helps maintain server stability for all users.

- **Rate Limit**: The maximum number of requests allowed within a specific time period (e.g., 100 requests per minute).
- **Reset Time**: The time at which the rate limit resets, allowing additional requests to be made.

## Safe Locker API Rate Limit Details

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Request Limit">
Safe Locker API requests are limited to:
- **100 requests per minute** (subject to change based on your usage plan).
</Tab>

<Tab title="Burst Limit">
Burst limits allow a short burst of requests exceeding the normal rate, but sustained high usage will still be rate-limited.
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Identifying Rate Limit Status

Each API response includes rate limit headers to help you track and manage your request usage. These headers provide information on your remaining requests and the reset time.

### Rate Limit Headers

| Header               | Description                                               |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `X-RateLimit-Limit`  | The total number of requests allowed in the current period. |
| `X-RateLimit-Remaining` | The number of requests remaining in the current period.  |
| `X-RateLimit-Reset`  | The time (in Unix timestamp) when the rate limit will reset. |

**Example Response Headers**:

<CodeBlock title="Rate Limit Headers Example" language="http">
```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
X-RateLimit-Limit: 100
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 5
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1640995200
```
</CodeBlock>

> **Tip**: Use `X-RateLimit-Remaining` to monitor available requests and avoid reaching the limit.

## Handling Rate-Limited Requests

If you exceed the rate limit, you will receive a `429 Too Many Requests` error. Here’s how to handle it effectively:

### 429 Too Many Requests Error

**Error Message**:
<CodeBlock title="429 Error Response Example" language="json">
```json
{
  "error": "Too Many Requests",
  "message": "You have exceeded the rate limit. Please wait before retrying."
}
```
</CodeBlock>

### Retry Strategy

When you receive a `429` error, wait until the rate limit resets before retrying. Use the `X-RateLimit-Reset` header to determine when it’s safe to retry.

<Callout title="Implement Retry Logic" type="tip">
Implement a retry mechanism with exponential backoff to handle `429` errors gracefully. Exponential backoff delays each retry attempt, reducing server load and increasing the chances of a successful request on the next attempt.
</Callout>

### Example Retry Logic in JavaScript

<CodeBlock title="Retry Logic Example" language="javascript">
```javascript
async function makeApiRequest(url, options, retries = 3) {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(url, options);
    if (response.status === 429) {
      const resetTime = response.headers.get("X-RateLimit-Reset");
      const waitTime = resetTime ? (resetTime - Date.now() / 1000) : 60;
      console.warn(`Rate limit exceeded. Retrying in ${waitTime} seconds.`);
      await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, waitTime * 1000));
      return makeApiRequest(url, options, retries - 1);
    }
    return await response.json();
  } catch (error) {
    if (retries > 0) {
      console.log("Retrying request...");
      return makeApiRequest(url, options, retries - 1);
    }
    throw error;
  }
}
```
</CodeBlock>

## Best Practices for Rate Limit Management

<Callout title="Best Practices" type="tip">
Follow these practices to optimize your API usage and avoid rate limits:
</Callout>

1. **Monitor Rate Limit Headers**: Track `X-RateLimit-Remaining` to avoid hitting the limit.
2. **Optimize API Requests**: Minimize redundant requests by caching data where possible and only fetching updates as needed.
3. **Use Exponential Backoff**: When retrying failed requests, use exponential backoff to manage retries efficiently.
4. **Batch Requests**: Group multiple operations into a single request, if supported, to reduce the total number of API calls.
5. **Implement Client-Side Throttling**: Regulate the rate of API requests in your application to avoid exceeding limits.

---

## Example Scenario: Rate Limiting in Action

Let’s say your application makes frequent requests to retrieve locker status information. To avoid exceeding the limit:

1. **Check `X-RateLimit-Remaining`**: Before each request, check how many requests you have left in the current period.
2. **Implement Retry Logic**: If a `429` error occurs, wait until the rate limit resets, as indicated by `X-RateLimit-Reset`.
3. **Batch Status Checks**: Consider batching locker status checks into a single API call to reduce request volume.

> **Pro Tip**: Set up automated alerts to notify you when approaching rate limits, allowing you to adjust request patterns proactively.
